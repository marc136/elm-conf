#+STARTUP: showeverything

* TODOS [3/6]
  - [X] Display an animation when connecting to another peer
  - [ ] If getUserMedia fails, allow retry
  - [X] Display kbps
  - [X] Use webrtc-media custom element to create the user's peer connection
  - [ ] Render UserWithoutWebRtc
  - [ ] Don't set WebRtcMedia.pc from js, use elm instead

* Ideas
  - Allow user to trigger a reconnection attempt after connection negotiation failure
  - Allow user to change devices inside session
    - polit-impolite caller pattern or
    - caller-callee pattern
  - Allow user to take a still image of herself
    - transmit still image to other users and display that during connection initiation
